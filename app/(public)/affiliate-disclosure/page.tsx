        <h2>What does this mean?</h2>
        <p>
          This means that if you click on a link to a retailer (such as Amazon) and make a purchase, we may receive a small percentage of that sale. This comes at <strong>no extra cost to you</strong>.
        </p>
        <h2>Does this influence our reviews?</h2>
        <p>
          No. Our reviews are based on our own research, testing, and analysis. We recommend products because we believe they are the best options for our readers, not because of the commission we might earn. In many cases, we recommend products that have no affiliate program at all if they are truly the best choice.
